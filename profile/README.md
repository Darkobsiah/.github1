# Berachain Foundation

The Berachain Foundation maintains repositories relating to the Berachain distributed ledger as well as generic tooling for Ethereum Virtual Machine and Cosmos chains.

Berachain is an EVM-compatible layer one blockchain, built using the Cosmos SDK, and secured by the novel Proof-of-Liquidity Consensus Protocol. Proof-of-Liquidity (POL), as an extension of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPOS), is facilitated by users staking assets to secure the chain, in return for rewards. However, unlike dPOS, Proof-of Liquidity enables users' staked assets to be put to productive use by providing liquidity as a common good.
